# Setup

## Add MCP Servers

Under 'mcp.json' add relevant information about the add and dup servers (see add.ts and dup.ts)

## Run Tests

Run MCP servers either by enabling on MCP client or directly running `npx tsx index.ts`

Run `npx tsx test_id_final.ts` to see fields extracted from test MCP server many of which are used in the hash function found in hash.ts
